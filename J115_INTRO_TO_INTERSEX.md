<h1>What is Intersex (Difference of Sex Development) then?</h1>


So now that we know how typical biological sex works, and how sex is determined in most cases, we can visit and define a difference of sex development, which is more colloquially known as an intersex condition. Difference of sex development (DSD) is the medical term for an individual who has a congenital and significant difference in their primary and secondary sex characteristics. This means that the individual has a significant difference in at least one of the five sex determinant characteristics that makes their set different from the typical: chromosomes, gonads, internal reproductive organs, genitalia and endocrine composition. This is a truly broad category, encompassing over 40 known conditions and with others that have yet to be classified or discovered. It is also understandable right now, that you may find this difficult to visualize or fully comprehend — most of us have never heard of DSD before, and it is hard to imagine something believed to be fundamental like anatomical sex being naturally different. And now, you are told there are over 40 different variations — most anyone would be grasping at straws. This is why I have created the categories below to better understand. 

Differences of sex development can be largely sorted into three different categories of their root cause: 

Chromosomal 
Sex determinant gene mutation
Sex hormone synthesis/receptor differences

1. Chromosomal DSDs

Chromosomal DSDs are defined by a difference in sex chromosome composition, meaning that the individual has a sex karyotype other than XX or XY. There can be a number of different compositions, with some more common than others. For example, having only one X chromosome, Turner’s syndrome, occur in 1 out of 2000 births. Similarly, having XXY chromosomes (often correlated with Klinefelter’s syndrome), occurs in 1 out of 1000 individuals. Other combinations can be mosaicism, which means that some cells have one karyotype and some cells have another. Another type is chimerism, which means that a pair of fraternal twins fused in the womb. 

So how does this occur in the womb? A chromosomal DSD is determined often before an egg is even fertilized. Remember how we established previously that in typical sex determination, the sperm’s sex chromosome component determines whether the fertilized embryo will be XY or XX? A chromosomal anomaly can occur if the sperm lacks a sex chromosome component, result in the embryo simply being X, or the sperm carries extra chromosomes (XY sperm for example), resulting in the egg being XXY. In some cases, the egg carries an extra chromosome component, and an XX egg can result in an XXY embryo or an XXX embryo. 

Chromosomal anomalies can also occur during cell meiosis and mitosis, when the fertilized egg begins to duplicate and grow into the embryo. An XY cell may split into X and XY, with one of the cells dropping an X. This would result in two different cell lines in the body, one being X and the other being XY, forming the case of XY/X mosaicism. Similarly, XXY may split into XY/XXY, or XX/XXY, and a number of other combinations. Sometimes the fertilized egg starts out with XXXY and due to the instability of this karyotype, splits into the more stable XX/XY, resulting in XX/XY mosaicism. 

Finally, a unique cause of chromosomal anomaly is chimerism, where there are two embryos to begin with, but one embryo dies and its material is absorbed into the other. This will result in a fetus whose body contains two sets of DNA altogether (so not just two or more sex karyotypes). 

How does this difference in sex chromosomes affect sex development? The answer to this is complicated. Sometimes, no effect happens whatsoever if the individual has mosaicism and the fragmented cell lines simply do not reach the gonads. Other times, mosaicism may cause one gonad to be a streak (a primitive group of cells that don’t grow into an organ), and the other to develop normally. It could cause ovaries to have a little bit of testicular tissue, and thus cause genitalia to develop resembling male. Similarly, it could cause testicles to have some ovarian tissue, and cause the development of a uterus in someone who otherwise developed male. It could also cause ovotesticular DSD, where one or both gonads is an ovotestis (a mix of ovarian and testicular tissue) or for the individual to have one ovary and one testis (and in the case of chimerism, two ovaries and two testes). 

For non mosaic chromosomal anomalies, such as Klinefelter’s and Turner’s syndrome, the extra or missing chromosome can affect the function of the reproductive organs, resulting in ovarian dysgensis in the case of Turner’s syndrome because of lacking genetic stability and testicular dysgenesis (or more specifically, dysgenesis of the seminiferous tubules) in Klinefelter’s syndrome as a result of incomplete X inactivation. 

2. Sex determinant gene mutation 

Sex determinant gene DSDs are defined by a mutation to one of the many genes that activate during fetal sex/gonadal differentiation, in someone with a typical XX or XY karyotype. As previously explained in the introduction to reproductive biology, sex is determined by the sperm, which will usually create an XY or XX karyotype. However, from this point onwards, a varied set of genes will govern how sex differentiation progresses. The SRY gene was mentioned as being crucial to the development of testes, and an XY fetus that lacks the SRY gene (XY sex reversal, Swyer’s) will develop female internal anatomy like the uterus, cervix and vagina, with female outer genitalia. Without the SRY gene, the testes wouldn’t form, and thus, the body default forms the female internal organs. However, because the fetus lacked the specific genes for ovarian differentiation due to the otherwise normal XY karyotype, an individual with Swyer’s possesses no ovaries, and will have streak gonads (non functional cell clumps) instead. Similarly, XX sex reversal, or de la Chappelle syndrome, works the exact same way with an XX karyotype that has acquired an SRY gene, which results in male genitalia, and working testes that produce testosterone but are unable to produce sperm. 

Other sex determinant gene mutations include agonadism or aphallia, which results in no gonads or no penis/clitoris. MRKH is the name of a condition where a genetic mutation causes a typical XX female fetus to not develop a uterus (while still having ovaries and female genitalia). XX or XY OTDSD is caused by a mutation to several genes that regulate gonad differentiation, and will cause an individual to develop ovotestes or mixed gonads. There are a number of sex determinant gene mutation DSDs, and they will all be listed below. 

Those with sex determinant gene mutations can appear in a variety of ways, but tend to not have any musculoskeletal or autoimmune issues that can be associated with those with chromosomal anomalies. Individuals with Swyer’s, agonadism, de la Chapelle, leydig cell hypoplasia, SF-1 mutation and similar mutations that cause gonads to have difficulty functioning, will require exogenous hormones to ensure pubertal development occurs/is completed and that bone density remains at a healthy level. While gonadectomy (removal of the gonads: ovaries, testes, or ovotestes) is never recommended and should not be done as an elective surgery for minors, the one exception where gonadectomy for the safety of the patient is in cases where one has streak gonads. Streak gonads have a high chance of developing cancers (most commonly, a gonadoblastoma), and they are unable to produce any hormones or gametes (sperm/eggs). 


3. Sex hormone synthesis/receptor difference

Hormone synthesis/receptor differences are a category of DSDs that result from the congenital lack of certain hormones or excess of hormones, that causes differences to genitalia and/or pubertal development. 



Do people with DSDs have a sex? 

We can also understand the different types of gonads that come up in DSDs:: 

Testicular

Ovarian 

Ovotesticular/Mixed Gonads

Streak Gonads

And we can also understand the pubertal phenotype, which defines an individual’s secondary sex characteristics (note that each category describes what someone’s body biases, there may still be significant differences): 

Female development 

Male development 

Mixed/Cycling development 

What about genitalia? Don’t we assign sex through genitals? 

People with DSDs do have a sex, just not in.a conventional way. They have a gonadal (primary) sex, and a functional (phenotypical) sex, and the primary and secondary sex may not match. The idea that those with DSDs do not have a sex, have a “broken” sex, or having an undefinable/fluid sex, has contributed to unethical medical practices of sterilizing and non consensually modifying (usually minors) those with DSDs. People have a right to retain their reproductive organs even if the composition is unconventional, and they have a right to their biological sex and a right to reproduction. 

What might someone with a DSD look like? 

Examples: CAIS, CAH, Mixed Gonadal Dysgenesis, 5ARD
