<h1>Have you come here to seek answers for questions you have harboured for your whole life?</h1>

Sometimes it can feel pretty lonely and despairing, like you are the only one out there who feels this way. Who has a body like this. At times, you might wonder if you look grotesque, because you look so different.

You may be constantly bothered by questions with no answers, ones you have seen doctor after doctor for, with no avail. With only the affirmation that you are strange, and you are alien, and you are wrong.

Or perhaps, you have set that aside and you are determined to find an answer as to why you are the way you are. Maybe not even answers, but some sort of lead. Something more compassionate than how medical professionals have treated you, something more accurate than what crops up online.

Maybe you have been trying to read up on all of this for a while, and Google either throws you articles behind a paywall or sources that are questionable in terms of their accuracy

Or most likely you are here not to find answers about yourself, but to learn about someone you love or just to satiate your curiosity after hearing the term "intersex" or "DSD" for the first time. This resource is pretty chill, and does not throw jargon at you without explanation or get overly confusing. It also makes the creator of this resource happy that someone who may have never been exposed to what a DSD is, might become aware and more knowledgeable through this resource.
