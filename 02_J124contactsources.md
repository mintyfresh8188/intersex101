They run a research group on intersex/DSD research with me, and our group has collaborated with several academic institutions co authoring studies. We also collaborate with InterACT in terms of sharing our research to those in need. We work on verifying the accuracy of medical literature on DSDs and compiling trustworthy studies that can help those with DSDs better understand their bodies and their medical documents. In addition, we compile this data in hopes of creating a database that will be able ot reach families, clinicians and others with DSDs that our support group and InterACT cannot. Currently, we were able to create a verified list of all known DSDs that fall under the umbrealla of "difference of sex development", and we have a few sources on each that provides succicnt explanations of what genetic mutations lead to this syndrome, and its most common endocrine and physical presentations. Some of us are more knowledgable about certain variations than others, but through a community of diverse individuals who all have different DSDs, we have been able ot connect with experts on other DSDs and have reliable contact/info on almost all DSDs in the [list](/list_of_variations.md).
